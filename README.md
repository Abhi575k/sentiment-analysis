# sentiment-analysis-on-amazon-reviews
This ML model trains from data collected from Amazon product reviews and predicts whether the review is positive [1] or negative [-1].

The training dataset "Reviews.csv" can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews.

As an attempt to make the code interactive, I have created an "input.txt" file in which reviews can be written to test the model.
The "input.txt" file is converted into "input.csv" with appropriate "keys" to avoid data type discrepancy.
